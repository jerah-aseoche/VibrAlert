# Setup & Run Instructions

## 1. Install dependencies (frontend & backend)

Run this command in the **frontend** directory:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

This will:

- Install all frontend dependencies

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment in the backend folder

- Install backend Python dependencies from requirements.txt


## 2. Start frontend 

Run this command in the **frontend** directory:

```bash
npm run start-all
```

This will start the frontend (Vite).

## Notes

- Make sure you run the `npm run install-all` **inside the frontend directory** to properly set up the frontend.

- If you encounter permission issues with the virtual environment activation, try running your terminal as Administrator or adjust to CMD (especially on Windows PowerShell).

- To stop server started by `npm run start-all`, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
